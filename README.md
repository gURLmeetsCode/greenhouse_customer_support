## Notes

* Opted to use css-grid styling instead of flexbox for more browser support. IE 8 does not support flexbox without a third party library.
* Used 'rem' instead of pixels, percents, em's because rem is friendly to users who may have the root width set to a different value due to visual impairment.
* Integrated a responsive design for tablet and mobile friendly use.
